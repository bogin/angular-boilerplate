## About
This is my Angular boilerplate. 
Here, I implemented concepts that I like in Angular.

This app started as a homework assignment for Wix. The goal was to write 
the Mines game. I took it a step further.

On the home page, you can find the Mines game, and in the nav bar,
you can see a link to the configuration.

Please configure the game and appearance as you like.


## Development server

Run `npm install` and `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
